CardChecker
===========

An implementation of the Luhn algorithm in the C programming language.

This is a very simple implementation of the algorithm used to validate credit card numbers. Please note that this program only analyzes the digits that comprise the credit card
numbers to verify that they fit the credit card number requirements, it is not connected to any credit card database, nor does it use the security code. The algorithm is well
known and I wanted a way to test my C programming skills.


Further Development
===================

-There should be validation to ensure that all digits are not the same (ex. 0000-0000-0000-0000)

-There could also be more validation work done with user input to make sure that all 16 digits of the card are entered.
